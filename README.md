# JData-competition
The competition was very interesting,Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time! :ï¼ˆ

This is my first time use **xgboost**
Link about xgboost:  [https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)
Find some documents for help 
[https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
[http://qkxue.net/info/214420/XGBoost](http://qkxue.net/info/214420/XGBoost)
and a [guide to parameter](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/)

Also, I find it's troublesome to install some python libs for windows, in which condition pip doesn't work, like... xgboost!
Luckly, I found this website including all common python libs, whl type file.[click here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
